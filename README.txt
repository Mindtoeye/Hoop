Hoop: a text mining and exploration workbench in Java. Primarily
designed for narrative event extraction and text-based event
forecasting, the workbench is a generic text and language
machine learning sandbox that can be adopted to a wide variety
of tasks.

INFO! Please do not use the provided IDE for major investments
in environment development since the project will be moved to
use the Eclipse Workbench architecture in the near future.

Initially written as a set of support code for graduate classes
and smaller narrative projects, the code is slowly growing to
encompass a larger text-based data mining framework.

This source set includes code written for other various graduate 
courses and is part of a larger research effort in the field of
interactive narrative (IN). Language Technologies (CMU, LTI 
http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) Courses that have contribute to this 
source base are:
 
05-834 Applied Machine Learning
11-719 Computational Models of Discourse Analysis
11-741 Information Retrieval
