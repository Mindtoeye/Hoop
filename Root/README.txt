Hoop works best with a root file system. You can compare this file system as
resembling something in between the root structure on a linux machine and
the project directory of an Eclipse project. Future versions of Hoop will
manage and maintain this structure but currently it is not maintined in
Git but instead tested and modified outside of the repository.
