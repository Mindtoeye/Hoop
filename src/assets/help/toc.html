Hoop: a text mining and language exploration workbench in Java. 
Primarily designed for event extraction and text-based event
forecasting, the workbench is a generic text and language
machine learning sandbox that can be adopted to a wide variety
of tasks. Hoop is a collection of modules (hoops) each of which 
can take linguistic input from one, process it and pass it onto
another. Combining those modules or hoops allows you to create
complex analysis systems.
</p>
<p>
Hoop is available through GitHub, at:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/Mindtoeye/Hoop">https://github.com/Mindtoeye/Hoop</a>
</p>
<p><b>Features:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li> Plug and play tools allowing you to stitch together custom tools
	<li> Rich API and developer support for rapid text analysis prototyping
	<li> Full integrated development environment
</ul>	
<p>
Currently the toolkit is being migrated to the Eclipse Workbench
and although all the core module code will stay the same and will migrate,
the integrated environment support will most likely drastically change.

<p><b>History</b></p>
</p>
<p>Initially written as a set of support code for graduate classes
and smaller narrative projects, the code is slowly growing to
encompass a larger text-based data mining framework.
