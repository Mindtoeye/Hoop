An example that takes a directory of text files, in this case from the directory system/import/*.txt and generates a lexicon or vocabulary in the comma delimited spreadsheet file: lexicon.csv.

You will find three columns containing converted data

column 1: an index or key into the lexicon

column 2: primary or stemmed lexicon entry (value)

column 3: the document set term count over all loaded documents

column 4-n: alternative versions of the term as index by the stemmed value
